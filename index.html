	<div class="explain">

	<p id="explain">The problem we have is that people text while driving and cause accidents. People get distracted and then they might die or kill other people in the accident.They can also damage the car or wreck anything around them. This makes a serious problem that we know we can solve.

Our solution is that they have to get the SafeWheel steering wheel cover. It will use bluetooth that will connect with their smartphones. If the wheel feels pressure, the bluetooth will lock the phone until the pressure is removed. This will prevent the urge to look at your phone while youâ€™re driving.
